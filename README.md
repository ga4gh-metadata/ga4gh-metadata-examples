# Examples of GA4GH metadata schema

This repository will contain data and information based implementation of a GA4GH schema structure. While it is not expected that GA4GH compliant resources mirror the schema in their internal structure, this project is aimed at showing the principle feasibility of such an approach, mainly to test & drive schema development.

Data & schemas represented here are not kept in a stable/versioned status, but are updated together with or anticipating GA4GH schema changes.

Current datasets:
* [arrayMap](http://arraymap.org)
* [metagenomic]
